Compiling with gcc hello_openmp.c : 
Only one "Bonjour" is printed.

Compiling with gcc -fopenmp hello_openmp.c : 
Five "Bonjour"'s are printed since we have five threads defined.
Changing the number of threads to 7 gives 7 "Bonjour"'s etc.
Removing the num_threads() clause makes it default to 4 threads.
Echoing the OMP_NUM_THREADS gives no output.
Changing the default number of threads to 3 by using export
works well and the program prints 3 "Bonjour"s. We also get
an output of 3 when we echo OMP_NUM_THREADS. Unset works and
now we get four prints.

omp_set_num_threads(7) sets the number of threads to 7
inside the function.
