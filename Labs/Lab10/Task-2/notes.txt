Wall times (threads = N)

N = 1 : 1.512215s
N = 2 : 1.527032s
N = 3 : 1.529547s
N = 4 : 1.567591s
N = 5 : 2.027037s
N = 6 : 2.556991s

It seems to increase with 0.5 secs per extra threads over the system.
If the number of threads is the same or fewer than the system,
the wall time is the same. From top, i see it maxes out at
399.7% system usage.
