TIMINGS

O0 / O2 / O3

MEMSET
Slow : 0,196s / 0,050s / 0,010s (All gave diffFound = 0)
Fast : 0,009s / 0,011s / 0,011s (All gave diffFound = 0)

Optimization flags usually set the for loop to use the memset and
memcpy functions so both version take the same time using O3.


LOOKUP
Slow : 0,371s / 0,095s / 0,072s (All gave myFact = 5040, i.e. 7!)
Fast : 0,090s / 0,028s / 0,023s (All gave myFact = 5040, i.e. 7!)

Slow version needs n-1 multiplications. Fast version is fast if the table 
is in the cache, then we only need at most n reads from cache. If
too many elements are needed and the list is flushed from cache, 
the lookup method is slower, it's also slower if the function can
be done in very few operations.

STRENGTH REDUCTION
Regular : 0,257s / 0,182s / 0,182s
Optimized : 0,229s / 0,155s / 0,154s

The values are correct after optimization
