Large or Small numbers

Float becomes inf if larger than 1e38 ~ 2^126
Double becomes inf if larger than 1e308 ~ 2^1023
Operations with inf or NaN returns inf or NaN respectively.
Addition of 1 with 1e-16 gives 1, which corresponds with the table.

NORMS: 0,239s / 0,144s / 0,144s / 0,084s
DENORMS: 4,794s / 3,780s / 3,776s / 0,084s

RESULTS (Output)

NORMS (In : 1e-35): 9.999999e-36 / same / same / same
DENORMS (In : 1e-39): 9.999960e-40 / same / same / 0e+00

Changing tiny to 1e-50 sets input and output to zero, thats because the
smallest subnormal number is around 1.4e-45, so everything smaller than
that gets flushed to zero. Tests with 1.401e-45 gave correct results and
same time as the denorm measurements before but 0.5e-45 gave zero as in and
output and same time as the norm measurements.
