Setting the attribute to detached, the program gives error code 22, by removing the join call,
the threads finishes their calculations. By not calling exit, the program doesn't wait for
the threads to finish but simply ends before we get the result. The advantage of a detached
thread seems to be if you don't need to join the result with main, so you don't have to wait
for the thread to finish while the main thread is doing work.
