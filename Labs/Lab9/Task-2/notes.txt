In the loop, we check if doitnow is zero, if it is then we lock the mutex, then when doitnow
is 1, we signal the condition to wake up. The function will go through the loop, and since
doitnow is 1, won't lock it again. It then exits the loop. Using top, we see that we only use
100% of the cpu, without the condition it was 200%

TIME

Without condition:
real	0m5,843s
user	0m11,680s
sys	    0m0,004s

With condition:
real	0m5,750s
user	0m5,750s
sys	    0m0,000s

If we don't call pthread_cond_signal, the thread won't wake up and the program gets stuck
