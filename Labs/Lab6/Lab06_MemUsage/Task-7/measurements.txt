O0 / O2 / O3

N = 1000
kij : 2,362s / 0,498s / 0,166s
ijk : 2,090s / 0,752s / 0,747s
jik : 1,983s / 0,652s / 0,652s
ikj : 1,538s / 0,256s / 0,137s

Notice that the permutations ending in j are the fastest, since
we walk over j in our sum, som moving over j means moving over
the elements adjacent in the cache. Similarly ikj is faster than kij
since k is at the innest loop in the line above.

Not blocked : 25,162s
Blocked Size 50 : 20,347s
Blocked Size 100 : 19,449s
Blocked size 125 : 19,435s
Blocked size 200 : 19,365s
Blocked size 250 : 19,286s
Blocked size 500 : 20,028s

Block size of 250 appears to be optimal
