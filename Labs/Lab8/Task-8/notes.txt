While running the code, we get a different sum each time. By adding a global mutex variable
initializing it in main, and locking it in the thread function, only one thread gets access to 
the sum loop. Then, the thread unlocks the sum loop and the next thread gets access and so on.
Then the threads are joined and the mutex is destroyed. With this I got the same result each
time.
