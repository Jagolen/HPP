According to the summary card, sections seems to be used in a
way to synchronize work done by the threads, i.e. first
do some work, then synch it, then do some more work. Instead
of having several parallel blocks.

Wall times:
1 thread : 2.876287s
2 threads : 1.454969s
3 threads : 1.459135s

Adding an extra function
1 thread : 4.348262s
2 threads : 2.891502s
3 threads : 1.466213s

In practise, it appears that one thread each takes one section
in the section block. If there are fewer threads than sections,
the threads takes the first number of sections corresponding to
the number of threads. Then when they are done, they take on
the next sections in the block and so one. For example if I had
3 sections and 2 threads, the first two sections finished at
the same time, then after a little while, the third section 
finished.
